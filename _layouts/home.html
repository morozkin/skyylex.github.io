[<a style="text-decoration: underline; white-space: pre; font-family: monospace; font-size: 13.3333px;" href="">about</a>] section contains more information related to my biography, hobbies and etc, in case you are interested in it. </div>

      <div> Probably you want to understand why do you need to read this blog? Actually, it's up to you to decide should you read it or not. I just could tell more information about it. I've started this blog as a try to share my thoughts about software engineering and related themes. It's one of the ways to organize experience and knowledge. And I will be glad if the provided information will be useful for someone, also it's worth to mention that I'm open to any suggestions, comments and argumented critisism. Contacts are available at the bottom of the page. </div>

      <div> Thank you for coming and I hope you'll enjoy! </div>
