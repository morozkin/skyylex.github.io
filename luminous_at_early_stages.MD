Luminous at the early stages

Introduction

I've chosen the word "Luminous" for the name of the project due to the fact that
there is a well-known association between the sun light and process of getting knowledge.
And from my opinion if the project completes as I imagine, it could put some light
on the things, which are not so easy to understand and explain.

Luminous project is a try to look on the learning algorithms from another perspective. To use visualization as accompanying tool for explaining how algorithms work.

Idea

There is an obvious reason of using visualization in the explaining process. 
The most simple fact is that impact on each type of sense varies greatly in memorizing results (for each individual person).
Combining several types of sense has more chance to be remembered. 
It would be not worse to mention that complex knowledge could be explained from different angles of view. 
And like put parts of puzzle together visualization could be one of the pieces to show whole picture.

Another point here is that algorithm should be very precise to accomplish it's task. There are several requirements such as finiteness, possibility of express in formal logic and deduction of the correctness. Even not determenistic algorithms could be proven using theory of chances. But all options that were described above relate to proof and analysis (of efficiency). This is mostly about conclusion and not about the cause. And the main thought here: design of the algorithm starts from idea. (I think even far: every design starts from idea).
