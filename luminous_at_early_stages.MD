Luminous at the early stages

Introduction

I've chosen the word "Luminous" for the name of the project due to the fact that
there is a well-known association between the sun light and process of getting knowledge.
And from my opinion if the project will be completed as I imagine, it could put some light
on the things, which are not so easy to understand and explain.

Idea

There is an obvious reason of using visualization in the explaining process. 
The most simple fact is that impact on each type of sense varies greatly in memorizing results (for each individual person).
Combining several types of sense has more chance to be remembered. 
It would be not worse to mention that complex knowledge could be explained from different angles of view. 
And like put parts of puzzle together visualization could be one of the pieces to show whole picture.
